# Create a RangeColumn chart to show ChatGPT's performance in academic and professional exams.
In a technical report released on March 27, 2023, OpenAI provided a comprehensive brief on its most recent model, known as GPT-4. Included in this report were a set of exam results, which we’ve visualized in the graphic above.

To benchmark the capabilities of ChatGPT, OpenAI simulated test runs of various professional and academic exams. This includes SATs, the bar examination, and various advanced placement (AP) finals. Notably, it passes a simulated version of the Uniform Bar Examination with a score in the top 10% of test takers. Thus the following sample shows how to visualize the diffference in exam scores in both GPT3.5 and GPT4.0
